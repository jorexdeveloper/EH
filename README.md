### INSTALLATION

All you have to do is download and extract the zip (from above), then add the library to your project.

Extract the zip and copy the folder **EH** to your project's **libs** directory (`.../YourProject/app/libs`), then add the library as a dependency in your application/module `build.gradle` (`.../YourProject/app/build.gradle`).

```groovy
dependencies {
  api project(':app:libs:EH:app')
}
```

### USAGE

Initialize **EH** in **Application** with a new **EH.Builder** instance, passing to it the application **Context**...

```java
// import the class

import com.cyberking.developer.eh.EH;

public class MyApplication extends Application {

    @Override
    public void onCreate () {

        // Create new Builder instance passing to it the application context

        new EH.Builder (this)
            .init (); // Initialize EH

        super.onCreate ();
    }
}
```

or in **Activity** as...

```java
// import the class

import com.cyberking.developer.eh.EH;

public class MyActivity extends Activity {

    @Override
    public void onCreate (Bundle savedInstanceState) {

        // Create new Builder instance passing to it the application context

        new EH.Builder (getApplicationContext ())
            .init (); // Initialize EH

        super.onCreate (savedInstanceState);
    }
}
```

### CONSTRUCTOR

```java
public EH.Builder (Context appContext)
```

### METHODS

Use these methods to set configurations for **EH** before call to `init ()`.

```java
public EH.Builder enable (boolean enable)
```
> Default Value : true

Enable/disable **EH**. If disabled, exceptions are forwarded to the **Default Uncaught Exception Handler** that was present before call to `init ()`.


```java
public EH.Builder runInBackground (boolean runInBackground)
```
> Default Value : true

Whether **EH** should run when app is stopped i.e after call to `onStop ()`.


```java
public EH.Builder addSuppressed (boolean add)
```
> Default Value : true

Whether to include suppressed exceptions in the crash log.


```java
public EH.Builder setMaxActivityLogs (int max)
```
> Default Value : 100

Set the maximum number of activity lifecycle logs/traces to include in the crash log. The last **max** logs are included in the log.


```java
public EH.Builder setMaxStackTraceSize (int size)
```
> Default Value : 100

Set the maximum number of stack traces to include in the crash log. The first **size** stack traces are included in the log.


```java
public EH.Builder addEmailAddresses (String... emailAddresses)
```
> Default Value : none

Add email addresses included in `Intent` used to forward/send crash log to developers.


```java
public void init ()
```
Initialize/set up **EH** with the configurations above.

**Tip :** You can change the configurations for **EH** after call to `init ()` by creating a new **EH.Builder** instance or the old one, initializing it with the new configurations and making another call to `init ()`.


### EXAMPLE

```java
// import the class

import com.cyberking.developer.eh.EH;

public class MyApplication extends Application {
    @Override public void onCreate() {
    
    // Create new Builder passing application context, then setting configurations and initializing EH
    
    new EH.Builder (this)
        .enable (true)
        .runInBackground (true)
        .setMaxActivityLogs (50)
        .setMaxStackTraceSize (50)
        .addEmailAddresses ("email0@gmail.com", "email1@gmail.com", "email2@gmail.com")
        .init ();
    }
}
```
