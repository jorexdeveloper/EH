### INSTALLATION

All you have to do is download and extract the zip (from above), then add the library to your project. See [here](https://www.google.com/) how to add library to project.

### USAGE

Initialize EH with a new `EH.Builder` instance, passing to it the application context...

```java
public class MyApplication extends Application {
    @Override public void onCreate() {
  
    // Create new Builder passing application context
   
    new EH.Builder(this)
        .init();
    ...
    }
}
```

or in `Activity` as

```java
public class MyActivity extends Activity {
    @Override public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
   
    // Create new Builder passing application context
   
    new EH.Builder(getApplicationContext())
        .init();
    ...
    }
}
```
